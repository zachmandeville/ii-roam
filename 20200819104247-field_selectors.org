#+title: field selectors

The API provides a way to filter objects through a mechanism called field selectors. Only objects where the specified field matches the specified selector value are returned.

* Example
looking only at warning events

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning
#+END_SRC
