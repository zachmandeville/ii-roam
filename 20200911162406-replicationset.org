#+title: replicationSet

replaced [[file:20200911162428-replicationcontroller.org][replicationController]] , basically the same (manages a set of pod replicas, e.g. if you say you want 3 of a pod to make sure there's always 3 available).  The difference is the method in which you can select which pods you want this resource to manage the replication of, you have far more expressive capabilities...

[[file:20200911162428-replicationcontroller.org][replicationController]] is going to be deprecated (if not already), but you may still find it in older deployments
