#+title: kubectl explain


This command works to explain any part of the kubernetes api, similar to emacs describe variable.

You can even do object mapping with it...like if you wanted to get an explanation of [[file:20200819083601-pods.org][pod]] , you could say

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
kubectl explain pod
#+END_SRC

If you wanted explanation of the spec field in a pod you could type, instead

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
kubectl explain pod.spec
#+END_SRC

And if you wanted to know the restartPolicy field in the pod.spec it is

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
kubectl explain pod.spec.restartPolicy
#+END_SRC

and on and on.
